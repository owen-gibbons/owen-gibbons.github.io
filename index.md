# Hey, I'm Owen

I'm a network engineer focused on building secure, resilient infrastructure with aspirations of becoming a security engineer.

## What I Do

I design and secure network infrastructures, with hands-on experience in routing, switching, and security controls. My background combines formal computer science education (BS from UMass Amherst) with practical certifications (Security+, Network+, A+) and a drive to learn how systems work.

Right now I'm pursuing my CCNA certification (expected December 2025) and looking for network engineering roles where I can apply my skills and build a strong foundation for a future in security engineering.

## Beyond Networking and Security

While networking and security are my professional focus, I also love learning about other areas of computer science when I have the time. I use Xubuntu Linux as my daily driver, which has naturally led to plenty of learning about operating systems, usually when troubleshooting why my PC won't boot or an app won't load (thanks, Linux).

I believe the best engineers mimic the constantly evolving field of technology by continuously learning about new topics and staying curious.

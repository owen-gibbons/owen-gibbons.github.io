<h1> Hey, I'm Owen </h1>
I'm an aspiring network engineer and recent graduate from UMass Amherst with a BS in CS. My interests lie in networking and security, with an end goal to become a security architect.

Over the past year, I have spent a significant amount of time learning about networking, both during my formal education with my Computer Networks and Mobile and Wireless Networks classes and during my studies for industry certifications like the CCNA and the CompTIA certifications (A+, Network+, Security+).

I'm currently preparing for my CCNA exam and building hands-on experience through Boson's NetSim labs and ExSim practice exams. I also plan to set up a firewall using pfSense once I obtain my CCNA to further build practical experience.

This combination of learning has given me a well-rounded understanding of networking theory and practice that strengthens my ability to design resilient networks.

For more information about my intended career path and rationale, check out [my plan](/plan).
